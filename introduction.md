Inroduction
-----


We would like every one of us to consider, as free thinkers devoid of 
bias, and try to analyse the principles in the spirit of truth so that they 
will enable us to realise the answers that we are searching for in our 
lives, the fundamental questions to our existence as human beings. 
Questions like why are we here? What is our purpose? Where have 
we come from? Where will we progress? 

We have tried our best to open the window by analysing the answers 
to such questions in eleven abstract and pragmatic principles, their 
expressions and their negations. 

We have tried our best to keep the contents as simple as possible so 
that knowledge is devoid of deception and is comprehensible to 
everyone. This book is more focused to this dimension and to this time 
frame as we live and continue to exist as human beings, based on 
what we feel and what we sense. Since some of the analysis and 
discussion cannot be substantiated or proved by science, we have 
kept the discussion of science to a minimum, but the emphasis is more 
in terms of the logical, theological, philosophical, ethical and historical 
perspective. 

The concepts that have been discussed and analysed extensively in 
this book have not been invented or recently discovered; they have 
been in existence from time immemorial. We are trying to approach 
them in a different perspective to obtain answers objectively with 
sound reasoning that will enable every one of us to think and question 
our reasoning and logic objectively, and to form our convictions and 
conclusions subjectively. 

We have introduced eleven concepts so that we will have a better 
perception and understanding of the principles. The guidelines on how 
to approach these principles, is that we either accept each principle or 
negate it. It is a do or die approach, but we don’t try to deviate because 
the result of deviation is negation. Any deviation will ultimately become 
negation when it crosses the threshold of deviation. 

For a better understanding and flow, we have grouped the principles 
into three categories: Principles of Expression, Principles of Creation and Principles of Essence and each principle is 
represented by a Visual Meme. 

The meme is like a gene in a DNA, the unit by which concept transfers. 
The gene is a unit by which information transfers in an organism. The 
meme is a unit by which information transfers in societies and cultures. 
Visual meme is a unit by which information transfers as icons or 
symbols in societies and cultures across the universe. 

Principles of Expression

####Freedom and Free will

**Concept:** The concept of freedom is also known as liberty, the ability 
to act or express without restraint or constraint at any given moment in 
time. It is the ability to act on the available options at a given instant. 
The knowledge of the options and the available options at any given 
moment are expressed by sages and wizards based on the 
observation of patterns and cycles of times for eons, on their 
calculation from the information and data. 

Liberty has been regarded in high esteem by various philosophical 
schools, societies and cultures throughout the ages. The best 
approach to exercise liberty is to learn from our own mistakes, from 
our experiences on a personal level, from history and from the past on 
a universal level. 

Free will is the capacity to choose a best course of action from among 
various alternatives at a given moment in time. The free will is a 
double-edged sword and acts in the same way as fire; it can save or 
kill, cook or burn. It all depends on the knowledge of the options and its 
implications. This enables us to enjoy freedom but we have to take 
accountability and responsibility for the choices we make and the 
actions we take. If we know all the options and their implications then 
we will not have the slightest regret in eternity when we reflect the path 
we took and choices we made. 

The education systems, political systems, religious systems, or any 
other systems for that matter, cannot dictate to any one of us to be 
their agents to represent the matrix of their ideologies and beliefs. It is 
the denial of the basic lifeline of our lives and our existence as human 
beings. 

Liberty is the breath of our lives; no one can deny or take that away 
from us without our consent. The choice is ours to breathe or not to, 
using our free will. This is one of the most powerful principles that give 
us the freedom to choose between to be or not to be, to live or to die. 

**Principle (Sagacity):** As the knowledge builds up, so freedom unfolds. 
It is the progression of the knowledge. Free will is the choice to 
express our freedom, to choose between to be and not to be, peace 
and war, harmony and discordance, knowledge and deception, reality 
and illusion. 

The principle of Freedom and Free will is the lifeline of our existence 
as human beings. Whoever negates or denies liberty, negate the very 
existence, the spirit of human beings. 

Existence is absolutely free to do what they know to be best. They are 
accountable for everything that has happened, is happening now and 
will happen in the future on a universal level. But we still have the 
freedom and free will, and are responsible for the choices we make in 
our lives on a personal level. 

####Equality 

**Concept:** The concept of equality means that each human being is 
equal despite one's nationality, ethnic group, or gender. It is a concept 
that holds that all people should be treated as equals under the law 
and the society at large.

**Principle (Law):** The Law is the Ethic reciprocity, the Golden rule, the 
fundamental expression of the Existence which teaches us to treat 
others as you would like to be treated. It is the basis for the modern 
concept of human rights, ethics and morality. Most of the world’s 
religions and many philosophers have testified this principle. 

Equality is the principle by which the Existence abides and makes 
decisions and takes actions. These correspond to the Universal Law 
by which the principles of Existence exist and expect us to abide by 
them, given the free will; the creation decides which way to go and is 
responsible for those choices and their consequences.

####Awareness

**Concept:** Thought is the product of reasoning, and the reason or 
thought is derived from awareness of oneself and the environment 
around us. Thinking involves complex processing of information like The Principles of Existence & Beyond 9 
reasoning, association, communication and perception. We express 
our thoughts as written scripts and oral speech.

The education system only provides us with the building blocks, like 
Lego, and helps us to think and know how others are thinking, but it 
cannot tell us what to think, what not to think or how to think. The 
education system per se cannot create or manufacture experts and 
genii. This is the reason why the experts in any given domain cannot 
be simulated or brain dumped or cloned, or cannot be mass produced 
like a commodity. They are unique. 

**Principle (Awareness):** The principle of Awareness is one of the key 
principles of expression. The thoughts that everyone thinks and 
express are a part of the whole. If we integrate the thoughts of all of us 
then they become whole and in turn become the thought of the 
Existence. 

####Empathy

**Concept:** Etymologically, the word ‘emotion’ is a composite of two 
Latin words: ex, meaning out, outward, and motio meaning movement, 
action, gesture. It is defined as a motivation that causes us to move or 
act; it is an expression of our feeling. 

We express our emotions as gestures, movements and actions. 
Sometimes our emotions lead to thoughts, sometimes thoughts lead to 
emotions. Our emotions have more emphasis than our thoughts. It is 
the fuel of our lives. It is the inherent power or the force that motivates 
us to live, express and to survive. It is the feeling that keeps us going, 
that enables us to withstand storms in our lives. We live to feel our 
emotions within ourselves and share our emotions with others. The 
currency of our lives is emotion, not gold, paper money and credit 
cards. 

**Principle (Vibe):** The emotions that everyone feels and express are a 
part of the whole. If we integrate the emotions of all of us they become 
whole and in turn become the emotion of the Existence. This is one of 
the key principles from which the Consciousness and Creation are 
derived. 

All the emotions that we feel are derived from acceptance, 
contentment and awareness like the three primary colours. When we 
accept any given situation, person or environment, we like it, love it, get lost 
in it and trust it. When we trust we are calm, confident, courageous 
and alert; we have hope and compassion. But when we do not accept, 
then we anticipate, get bored, irritated, agitated, frustrated; we feel anger, rage, contempt and hate, which leads to doubt. When we doubt, 
we are anxious, get confused, desperate, have fear, panic and are 
horrified. 

When we are content we are happy, joyful, elated, euphoric, glad, 
delighted, amused and we are in ecstasy, but when we are not content 
we are greedy, envious, jealous, disappointed, bitter, feel disgust, feel 
pain, suffer and get depressed.

When we know who we are, we are complete and humble. But when 
we do not know who we are, we are proud, we feel humiliated and 
embarrassed, feel empty, feel lonely, regret, remorse, self pity and 
shame. 

The expression of the Existence is Thought, Emotion and Law. The 
expression is a spectrum and is dual in nature. When we learn to 
balance and moderate we express Sagacity, but if we polarise we 
express Satanism. 

Principles of Creation
-----

####Idea

**Concept:** Concept is an abstract idea or a mental symbol, associated 
with a corresponding representation in language or symbols. 
A concept denotes all the entities, phenomena, their relations in a 
given category or class. Concepts are abstract in that they omit the 
differences of the things in their extension, treating the members of the 
extension as if they were identical. Concepts are universal in that they 
apply equally to everything in their extension. 

The knowledge is based on concepts and symbols which in turn are 
based on information or data gathered by our senses, rather than 
information per se; it is subjective and objective. We know others 
concepts by education and express our concepts as writing, icons and 
logos. 

**Principle (Simplicity):** Abstraction is the process of building 
knowledge by reducing the information content of a concept, or an 
observable phenomenon, in order to retain only information which is 
relevant. It is the process of separating the concept from awareness. It 
is like a sacred white swan which the folktales claim has the ability to 
separate milk and water. Abstraction is one of the key principle from 
which all creation is derived. 

####Consciousness

**Concept:** Consciousness is the ability to perceive the relationship 
between oneself and one's environment by experience. 
Consciousness is like an onion or a Russian doll: it is the nth level of 
perception and nth level of illusion. As the perception changes, so the 
reality keeps changing; it is like the view of the city from the road, from 
a tower, from a plane, from a satellite, from a solar system, from the 
Milky Way and so on. The pragmatic explanation of consciousness is 
what each one of us experiences every single day of our lives, whether 
good or bad. 

The concept of experience refers to know-how or procedural 
knowledge, rather than propositional knowledge, which is known as 
epistemology. Philosophers address knowledge based on experience 
as empirical knowledge, or a posteriori knowledge. The religious 
traditions, such as mysticism and the philosophy of empiricism, are 
based on experience. 

There are different types of experiences. Firsthand experience is that 
which we experience. Our personal experience can be biased by 
subjective perception and personal deductive inference. Second-hand 
experience is recorded and summarised information from first hand 
experience. Third-hand experience is the interpretation of the recorded 
and summarised information. 

**Principle (Experience):** As we experience, we unfold the Cosmic 
Consciousness. We can perceive consciousness as a wide spectrum 
of thoughts and emotions. Thoughts can be beliefs at one end and 
facts at the other end and emotions can be ecstasy at one end and 
extreme fear at the other end. Consciousness and Creation resonate 
at a quantum level. 

####Blend

**Concept:** Most of the religions believe that God created the universe 
from nothing. Ex nihilo in Latin means out of nothing. It is used to 
explain creation, as in creatio ex nihilo, meaning creation out of 
nothing. 

As we resonate in harmony, peace and love, life unfolds transforming 
the fool into a sage. Likewise, as we resonate in discordance, chaos 
and hate, life unfolds transforming the fool into satan. It is an 12 Visual Memes 
expression based on love and peace, or chaos and hate. From 
whichever angle we look, life is rhythm divine. It is the rhythm of the 
heart beat, the waves of the ocean, songs of the birds, flow of the 
stream in the woods, motion of the planets, stars of the galaxy and 
galaxies in the universe. 

**Principle (Beauty):** Life unfolds as the consciousness which is 
experience from infinity, blends with matter which is vibration from the 
void, triggering the rivers of time for eons. It simply means blending of 
the yin and the yang.

When there is balance and equilibrium in our lives, then there is 
rhythm and peace in each and every one of us. When these qualities 
are absent, even though there may be plenty in our lives, we will still 
lack the peace, and rhythm, and we will not feel the melody. 

Life is a university; we learn our lessons by experiencing pleasure and 
pain, which eventually leads us to be transformed into a Sage if we 
express peace, harmony and love, or a Satan, like a Dracula or 
Vampire, if we express hate and discordance, sucking the life of others 
because they do not have a life of their own. They have to hunt the life 
of animals, plants and planets in the galaxy and the universe. 

The choice is ours; it is our liberty and free will to choose to become a 
sage or a satan, as we have the potential to become both. If we evolve 
into a sage we will have eternal life and freedom, but if we evolve into 
satan we will have eternal pain and bondage, hunting for freedom, 
harmony, the rhythm, the Holy Grail, which will be evading us forever.

####Justice

**Concept:** Natural justice maintains order and harmony in the society. 
We live in peace because of order; otherwise there would be chaos 
and civil war everywhere. It is implemented in two modes: as 
distribution of resources and retribution of offences.

The proportionality of distribution of the resources varies from 
aristocracy which is based on status, socialism which is based on 
equality, meritocracy or capitalism which is based on what each 
deserves, and communism which is based on what each of us needs. 

Proportionality of retribution varies from compassion and mercy on the 
one hand, and tit for tat on the other; it means we will be forgiven with 
no compensation or retribution at one end of the spectrum, and eye for 
an eye (tit for tat) on the other end of the spectrum.

The proportionality of distribution and retribution has been an ongoing 
debate among the legal, theological and philosophical schools for 
ages. 

**Principle (Equity):** Justice is based on Law and Equity. Equity is the 
name given to the set of legal principles, which supplement strict rules 
of law, so as to achieve Natural justice. Equity issues injunctions or 
decrees directing someone either to act or to forbid from acting. Often 
this form of relief is in practical terms more valuable to a litigant in 
terms of time. 

The Law is the principle of Equality, the Ethic reciprocity which is 
neither mutable nor negotiable in Eternity, in Infinity or in Void. 

The proportionality of distribution should be based on Law, which 
means we will either progress by helping others to progress, or regress 
by inhibiting the progress of others. If we progress others we will be 
progressed, but if we regress others we will therefore be regressed. 

The proportionality of retribution should be based on Law, which 
means that if we forgive others we will be forgiven, if we reattribute 
others we will be reattributed. Mercy is shown to those who express 
mercy to other creatures like human beings, animals and plants. If we 
take lives our lives will be taken, if we give life to others we get life.

The Creation is created by Abstraction, explores the Consciousness 
and is terminated by Equity. The creation is a spectrum and it is infinite 
in nature. If the creation is based on love and peace it will have life and 
freedom, but if it is based on hate and discordance it will be a bonded 
slave. 

Principles of Essence
-----

####Alchemy(Infinity)

**Concept:** Change is change for good, freedom, life and for betterment, 
or change for worse, slavery and death. It means setting things right, 
correcting errors and mistakes, learning our lessons from our 
mistakes. Alchemy is the process of transmutation or transformation, 
which means changing base metal to noble metal, changing death to 
life, void to stillness. 

When we observe the life cycle of a butterfly, it goes through a process 
of different stages of change, by which the ugly larva becomes the 
most beautiful butterfly through change. 

**Principle (Recycle):** It is the transmutation of right to left and left to 
right, above to below and below to above. It is the transmutation of 
death to life by moving from slavery to freedom, from knowledge of 
good and evil to knowledge of freedom and free will, transforming a 
fool to a sage. It can be from void to stillness, stillness to void, nothing 
to everything and everything to nothing. We have to lose form to 
transform, detach form to get life and freedom. If we get attached to 
form we will lose life and get into bondage. 

####Unity


**Concept:** Understanding the nature and meaning of unity and symmetry is one of 
the key themes in the philosophical discipline known as aesthetics. 
The subjective experience of unity involves the interpretation of the 
entity as being in balance and harmony with nature, which may lead to 
feelings of attraction and emotional well-being. 

**Principle (Immortality):** The unity is the undifferentiated plane from 
which everything differentiates. This is where the journey of the mystic 
whose quest for enlightenment and spiritual truth ends. 
Unity is defined by ascetics and mystics as timeless existence, 
where time stops or time ceases to exist. Past, present and future 
merge into the unity, the now. It is a state in which we lose ourselves and our 
identity. It is the state of ecstacy and bliss where each one of us and 
everything around us ceases to exist and stays eternal. It is the state 
where space, time, subject and object becomes one. 

####Eternity

**Concept:** To many contemporary philosophers, Being and becoming has been a 
bone of contention since the time of Socrates; it gets complicated and 
cannot be explained or described when philosophers and the 
intellectuals try to explain the concept objectively. The 
reason for this is because it has two components, essence and existence, nameless 
and name, expression and expressionless.

If we observe trees and animals in nature, or the stars in the universe, 
what we sense with our senses is thought and feel. It can be 
expressed objectively, but the potential behind the stars, galaxies and the multiverse 
is the essence, it cannot be expressed objectively. 

Existence(Becoming) is the Name and Essence(Being) is the Nameless, we have to have 
faith in the Essence. Faith is termed as belief without reason, neither 
tangible nor comprehensible. The million dollar question is what to 
believe in. Faith can make or break a person; it all depends on what 
we believe in. The belief should be based in the Being but not on the dogmas, 
powers and ideologies dictated by religious systems, political systems 
and the financial systems. 

The moment we have faith in the Essence, miracles will manifest, but 
the moment we have faith in our sanity, dogmas and equations, evil 
will manifest in the form of chaos and entropy. 

Stillness means no movement, no noise, no emotion and no thought. It 
is a silence that leads to tranquility and serenity. It is as gentle and 
light as a touch of a feather. Void is the reverse of stillness. The 
fundamental difference between stillness and void is that stillness is 
everything, whereas void is nothing. Both look similar, but void does 
not lead to tranquility and serenity, instead it creates a web of illusion 
and a sense of nothingness or emptiness. 

The stillness can be experienced by each one of us as it resides deep 
inside us. In our lives we are so much lost in our thoughts, our 
passions, our talks, our expressions and our movements that we fail to 
acknowledge the Being. We ignore it, eventually moving away from 
stillness towards void. If we continue to lead our lives as we do, we will 
lose everything and become nothing. We are heading for a cross-road. 
The choice is ours. By using our free will we have to decide and act 
which way to go. We have evolved to a point where we have to start 
taking responsibility and accountability for our own lives instead of blaming others for our 
decisions and actions. 

**Principle (Stillness):** The kiss of the breeze and eye of the cyclone 
can only be felt but cannot be captured in a container. 
Stillness is the silence. It is the silence that exists for infinity and 
speaks for eternity in infinite languages. It is the silence in the eye of 
the cyclone which creates the storm, thunder and lightning. It is the 
silence in the black holes that creates the galaxies, the stars, quantum, 
quarks, photons and us. It is the stillness that the ascetics and mystics 
tried to comprehend and experience. It is the stillness that is 
incomprehensible to the intellectuals. 

**The principle of Essence is Omniscient (Cyclical), Omnipotent 
(Unified) and Omnipresent (Still).**
