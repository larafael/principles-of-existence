Inroduction
-----


We would like every one of us to consider, as free thinkers devoid of 
bias, and try to analyse the principles in the spirit of truth so that they 
will enable us to realise the answers that we are searching for in our 
lives, the fundamental questions to our existence as human beings. 
Questions like why are we here? What is our purpose? Where have 
we come from? Where will we progress? 

We have tried our best to open the window by analysing the answers 
to such questions in eleven abstract and pragmatic principles, their 
expressions and their negations. 

We have tried our best to keep the contents as simple as possible so 
that knowledge is devoid of deception and is comprehensible to 
everyone. This book is more focused to this dimension and to this time 
frame as we live and continue to exist as human beings, based on 
what we feel and what we sense. Since some of the analysis and 
discussion cannot be substantiated or proved by science, we have 
kept the discussion of science to a minimum, but the emphasis is more 
in terms of the logical, theological, philosophical, ethical and historical 
perspective. 

The concepts that have been discussed and analysed extensively in 
this book have not been invented or recently discovered; they have 
been in existence from time immemorial. We are trying to approach 
them in a different perspective to obtain answers objectively with 
sound reasoning that will enable every one of us to think and question 
our reasoning and logic objectively, and to form our convictions and 
conclusions subjectively. 

We have introduced eleven concepts so that we will have a better 
perception and understanding of the principles. The guidelines on how 
to approach these principles, is that we either accept each principle or 
negate it. It is a do or die approach, but we don’t try to deviate because 
the result of deviation is negation. Any deviation will ultimately become 
negation when it crosses the threshold of deviation. 

For a better understanding and flow, we have grouped the principles 
into three categories: Principles of Expression, Principles of Creation and Principles of Essence and each principle is 
represented by a Visual Meme. 

The meme is like a gene in a DNA, the unit by which concept transfers. 
The gene is a unit by which information transfers in an organism. The 
meme is a unit by which information transfers in societies and cultures. 
Visual meme is a unit by which information transfers as icons or 
symbols in societies and cultures across the universe.

####Freedom and Free will

**Concept:** The concept of freedom is also known as liberty, the ability 
to act or express without restraint or constraint at any given moment in 
time. It is the ability to act on the available options at a given instant. 
The knowledge of the options and the available options at any given 
moment are expressed by sages and wizards based on the 
observation of patterns and cycles of times for eons, on their 
calculation from the information and data. 

Liberty has been regarded in high esteem by various philosophical 
schools, societies and cultures throughout the ages. The best 
approach to exercise liberty is to learn from our own mistakes, from 
our experiences on a personal level, from history and from the past on 
a universal level. 

Free will is the capacity to choose a best course of action from among 
various alternatives at a given moment in time. The free will is a 
double-edged sword and acts in the same way as fire; it can save or 
kill, cook or burn. It all depends on the knowledge of the options and its 
implications. This enables us to enjoy freedom but we have to take 
accountability and responsibility for the choices we make and the 
actions we take. If we know all the options and their implications then 
we will not have the slightest regret in eternity when we reflect the path 
we took and choices we made. 

The education systems, political systems, religious systems, or any 
other systems for that matter, cannot dictate to any one of us to be 
their agents to represent the matrix of their ideologies and beliefs. It is 
the denial of the basic lifeline of our lives and our existence as human 
beings. 

Liberty is the breath of our lives; no one can deny or take that away 
from us without our consent. The choice is ours to breathe or not to, 
using our free will. This is one of the most powerful principles that give 
us the freedom to choose between to be or not to be, to live or to die. 

**Principle (Sagacity):** As the knowledge builds up, so freedom unfolds. 
It is the progression of the knowledge. Free will is the choice to 
express our freedom, to choose between to be and not to be, peace 
and war, harmony and discordance, knowledge and deception, reality 
and illusion. 

The principle of Freedom and Free will is the lifeline of our existence 
as human beings. Whoever negates or denies liberty, negate the very 
existence, the spirit of human beings. 

Existence is absolutely free to do what they know to be best. They are 
accountable for everything that has happened, is happening now and 
will happen in the future on a universal level. But we still have the 
freedom and free will, and are responsible for the choices we make in 
our lives on a personal level. 

####Equality 

**Concept:** The concept of equality means that each human being is 
equal despite one's nationality, ethnic group, or gender. It is a concept 
that holds that all people should be treated as equals under the law 
and the society at large.

**Principle (Law):** The Law is the Ethic reciprocity, the Golden rule, the 
fundamental expression of the Existence which teaches us to treat 
others as you would like to be treated. It is the basis for the modern 
concept of human rights, ethics and morality. Most of the world’s 
religions and many philosophers have testified this principle. 

Equality is the principle by which the Existence abides and makes 
decisions and takes actions. These correspond to the Universal Law 
by which the principles of Existence exist and expect us to abide by 
them, given the free will; the creation decides which way to go and is 
responsible for those choices and their consequences.

####Awareness

**Concept:** Thought is the product of reasoning, and the reason or 
thought is derived from awareness of oneself and the environment 
around us. Thinking involves complex processing of information like The Principles of Existence & Beyond 9 
reasoning, association, communication and perception. We express 
our thoughts as written scripts and oral speech.

The education system only provides us with the building blocks, like 
Lego, and helps us to think and know how others are thinking, but it 
cannot tell us what to think, what not to think or how to think. The 
education system per se cannot create or manufacture experts and 
genii. This is the reason why the experts in any given domain cannot 
be simulated or brain dumped or cloned, or cannot be mass produced 
like a commodity. They are unique. 

**Principle (Awareness):** The principle of Awareness is one of the key 
principles of expression. The thoughts that everyone thinks and 
express are a part of the whole. If we integrate the thoughts of all of us 
then they become whole and in turn become the thought of the 
Existence. 

####Empathy

**Concept:** Etymologically, the word ‘emotion’ is a composite of two 
Latin words: ex, meaning out, outward, and motio meaning movement, 
action, gesture. It is defined as a motivation that causes us to move or 
act; it is an expression of our feeling. 

We express our emotions as gestures, movements and actions. 
Sometimes our emotions lead to thoughts, sometimes thoughts lead to 
emotions. Our emotions have more emphasis than our thoughts. It is 
the fuel of our lives. It is the inherent power or the force that motivates 
us to live, express and to survive. It is the feeling that keeps us going, 
that enables us to withstand storms in our lives. We live to feel our 
emotions within ourselves and share our emotions with others. The 
currency of our lives is emotion, not gold, paper money and credit 
cards. 

**Principle (Vibe):** The emotions that everyone feels and express are a 
part of the whole. If we integrate the emotions of all of us they become 
whole and in turn become the emotion of the Existence. This is one of 
the key principles from which the Consciousness and Creation are 
derived. 

All the emotions that we feel are derived from acceptance, 
contentment and awareness like the three primary colours. When we 
accept any given situation, person or environment, we like it, love it, get lost 
in it and trust it. When we trust we are calm, confident, courageous 
and alert; we have hope and compassion. But when we do not accept, 
then we anticipate, get bored, irritated, agitated, frustrated; we feel anger, rage, contempt and hate, which leads to doubt. When we doubt, 
we are anxious, get confused, desperate, have fear, panic and are 
horrified. 

When we are content we are happy, joyful, elated, euphoric, glad, 
delighted, amused and we are in ecstasy, but when we are not content 
we are greedy, envious, jealous, disappointed, bitter, feel disgust, feel 
pain, suffer and get depressed.

When we know who we are, we are complete and humble. But when 
we do not know who we are, we are proud, we feel humiliated and 
embarrassed, feel empty, feel lonely, regret, remorse, self pity and 
shame. 

The expression of the Existence is Thought, Emotion and Law. The 
expression is a spectrum and is dual in nature. When we learn to 
balance and moderate we express Sagacity, but if we polarise we 
express Satanism. 

Prniciples of Creation

####Idea

**Concept:** Concept is an abstract idea or a mental symbol, associated 
with a corresponding representation in language or symbols. 
A concept denotes all the entities, phenomena, their relations in a 
given category or class. Concepts are abstract in that they omit the 
differences of the things in their extension, treating the members of the 
extension as if they were identical. Concepts are universal in that they 
apply equally to everything in their extension. 

The knowledge is based on concepts and symbols which in turn are 
based on information or data gathered by our senses, rather than 
information per se; it is subjective and objective. We know others 
concepts by education and express our concepts as writing, icons and 
logos. 

**Principle (Simplicity):** Abstraction is the process of building 
knowledge by reducing the information content of a concept, or an 
observable phenomenon, in order to retain only information which is 
relevant. It is the process of separating the concept from awareness. It 
is like a sacred white swan which the folktales claim has the ability to 
separate milk and water. Abstraction is one of the key principle from 
which all creation is derived. 

####Consciousness

**Concept:** Consciousness is the ability to perceive the relationship 
between oneself and one's environment by experience. 
Consciousness is like an onion or a Russian doll: it is the nth level of 
perception and nth level of illusion. As the perception changes, so the 
reality keeps changing; it is like the view of the city from the road, from 
a tower, from a plane, from a satellite, from a solar system, from the 
Milky Way and so on. The pragmatic explanation of consciousness is 
what each one of us experiences every single day of our lives, whether 
good or bad. 

The concept of experience refers to know-how or procedural 
knowledge, rather than propositional knowledge, which is known as 
epistemology. Philosophers address knowledge based on experience 
as empirical knowledge, or a posteriori knowledge. The religious 
traditions, such as mysticism and the philosophy of empiricism, are 
based on experience. 

There are different types of experiences. Firsthand experience is that 
which we experience. Our personal experience can be biased by 
subjective perception and personal deductive inference. Second-hand 
experience is recorded and summarised information from first hand 
experience. Third-hand experience is the interpretation of the recorded 
and summarised information. 

**Principle (Experience):** As we experience, we unfold the Cosmic 
Consciousness. We can perceive consciousness as a wide spectrum 
of thoughts and emotions. Thoughts can be beliefs at one end and 
facts at the other end and emotions can be ecstasy at one end and 
extreme fear at the other end. Consciousness and Creation resonate 
at a quantum level.
