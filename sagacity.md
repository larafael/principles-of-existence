>Breathe Freedom, the Spirit of the Existence

####1.1. Introduction

All of us do not live for food, but live to express and experience. If we do 
not express and exercise our liberties then we do not live anymore, and our lives 
cease to exist. In order to breathe freedom we have to be aware, 
aware of the options, aware of the law, aware of the harmony, aware 
of simplicity, aware of now, aware of change, aware of stillness. 

Freedom is making decisions and actions in our lives without any 
constraints and restraints. But in the real world, all of us at some point 
in our lives have felt that there is no real freedom. It is true that in our 
day-to-day lives we operate under different constraints like social, 
economical, ethical and biological which restraints us. There are 
specific genes and chemicals in the brain that determines addiction 
and gambling which is a biological, genetic constraint. When we make 
decisions, many of us think about social and ethical constraints 
involving others and the society. We have to take into consideration 
our personal economy constraints in terms of positive or negative 
consequences. 

Are we really free? The answer is yes and no, it depends on our 
perception. When we watch a soccer game, the rules of the game, the 
players in the game and venue is predetermined. It is the same for any 
sport for that matter, but how the game is played, what tactics and 
strategies are applied for defence and offence is entirely dependent on 
the experience and wisdom of the players. They have complete 
freedom inside the football pitch, but they have no freedom outside the 
pitch. They have no control or freedom to decide the rules of the game 
or the team players or the opponents in the game. 

If we concentrate on the game of life by accepting the rules of the 
game, ourselves as we are, our team as they are, then we will enjoy 
absolute freedom in life and we will win the game of life by mastering 
life. If we try to change the rules of the game, to change ourselves, our 
friends by knowledge which is power and occult, we will lose miserably 
in the game of life. By using occult knowledge we are violating the 
freedom and free will of others and the Law of the Existence. Let us 
not try to do any hair splitting by challenging the Law. Let us be fair to 
ourselves and to others in playing the game of life, by accepting what 
cannot be changed and concentrate our efforts on what can be 
changed through the wisdom of the sages and therefore win the game 
of life. 

>Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, 
the courage to change the things I can, and 
the wisdom to know the difference. 

>**Francis of Assisi** 

We human beings, every one of us, are a blend of good and evil. The war of good and evil is going on within each one of us, and it should be won by each one of us deep inside us, not outside. Society and the world is a reflection and projection of what we are deep inside. 

The issues of good and evil in theology, philosophy and in our day-to-day life can be resolved by the virtue of Temperance. It is the delicate balance brought in by the practice of moderation. Moderation is the process of eliminating, or lessening, extremes and maintains the equilibrium and the balance. It was one of the Four Cardinal Virtues of the Hellenic culture. It is one of the Four Cardinal Virtues central to Christian behaviour advocated by the Church and it is one of the Five Precepts of Buddhism.

The English word ‘spirit’ is derived from the Latin spiritus, which means 
breath. The Spirit is the temperance, the practice of moderation. It is 
the virtue of Temperance that liberates creation. In ancient Greece, the 
temple of Apollo at Delphi bore the inscription Meden Agan which 
means 'Nothing in excess'. 

####1.2. Free Will 

Free will is the expression of our freedom to choose between peace 
and war, concordance and discordance, knowledge and deception, 
love and hate, faith and idolatry, good and evil. 

Free will is the absolute freedom to choose between various choices 
we make and various actions we take in our lives. The principle of Free 
will is very powerful and the religious, ethical, and social implications of 
this principle are critical and vital for our existence. The free will is a 
double-edged sword; the application of free will differentiates human 
beings between Sage and Satan. 

The Seven Sages of Greece (620 BC–550 BC) was the title given by 
Greek tradition to seven wise Greek men who were philosophers, 
statesmen and law-givers. 

The Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove was a group of Chinese 
Taoist Qingtan scholars, writers, and musicians who came together in 
the third century. As is traditionally depicted, the group wished to 
escape the intrigues, corruption and stifling atmosphere of court life 
during the politically fraught Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history. 
They gathered in a bamboo grove near the house of Xi Kang (Ji Kang) 
in Shanyang where they enjoyed, and praised in their works, the 
simple, rustic life. This contrasted with the politics of court. The Seven 
Sages stressed personal freedom, spontaneity and a celebration of 
nature. 

The Saptarshi, which means ‘Seven Sages’ in Sanskrit, are the Seven 
Sages who are extolled in the Vedas and other Hindu literature. They 
are regarded in the Vedas as the patriarchs of the Vedic religion.

####1.3. Good and Evil

Good and evil are intrinsic to human nature, because it is who we are; 
it is the fundamental concept of our existence as human beings. We 
can express both love or hate, can be wise or ignorant, can be in war 
and at peace, can express beauty or averse. Our intentions can be 
good or evil. We are both good and evil. It is the basis and foundation 
of the expression of our freedom and our free will to choose between 
the two; whoever negates this, negates our very existence as human 
beings. Can any one of us challenge that, in our lifetimes, we never 
expressed evil? This is who we are, we have to accept who we are 
and exist as we are. Let us come to terms in accepting who we are. 

The problem of good and evil is not the issue of being good or being 
evil, but how we handle or manage them. The objective, or the lesson, 
we have to learn in our lifetime, the purpose why we are here, is to 
learn how to manage by moderation. If we don’t moderate we tend to 
polarise emotionally or rationally either to good or evil. If we polarise to 
the sides emotionally, we will become a fundamentalist in a religion or 
cult and we sacrifice ourselves. If we polarise to the sides rationally, 
we will become a rationalist, trying to manipulate and control and 
deceive others. Both the fundamentalist and the rationalist are the 
deviations: fundamentalists become slaves to dogmas, and the 
rationalists become slaves to half-truths. Both are deviations of 
freedom, which will not survive the acid test, the Infinity. 

Augustine says that it belongs to temperance to preserve one's 
integrity and freedom from corruption for God's sake. Let us respect 
freedom, the greatest gift of humanity, by asserting our free will and 
freedom as human beings over the will and freedom of the deviations. 

####2. Civil Liberty

The freedom on a universal objective level as a group or a society is 
known as civil liberty - the ability to be liberated from bondage or to 
defend from bondage. In our lives, if we appreciate our liberties, we 
have to appreciate the responsibility and accountability of our lives. We 
will not be able to blame others for our shortcomings in our lives. 
Civil liberties protect the individual from the government. Civil liberties 
set limits for the government so that it can not abuse its power and 
interfere with the lives of its citizens. 

Common civil liberties include freedom of association, freedom of 
assembly, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and due process, to 
a fair trial, and to privacy. 

####2.1. MagnaCarta 

The formal concept of civil liberties dates back to the Magna Carta of 
1215. Magna Carta, which is a Latin term for Great Charter, or Great 
Paper, also called Magna Carta Libertatum (‘Great Charter of 
Freedom’), is an English Charter originally issued in 1215. The Magna 
Carta influenced much common law and other documents, such as the 
United States Constitution and Bill of Rights, and is considered to be 
one of the most important legal documents in the history of democracy. 

The Magna Carta was originally written because of disagreements 
between Pope Innocent III, King John and his English barons about 
the rights of the king. The Magna Carta required the king to renounce 
certain rights, respect certain legal procedures and to accept that the 
will of the king could be bound by the law. It explicitly protected certain 
rights of the king's subjects, whether free or fettered, and most notably 
the right of Habeas Corpus, meaning that they had rights against 
unlawful imprisonment. 

####2.2. Human Rights 

The Human Rights is based on the principle of Civil liberties and the 
principle of Equality which is addressed in the next chapter. 
The Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedom, also known as the European Convention on Human Rights 
(ECHR), was adopted under the auspices of the Council of Europe in 
1950 to protect human rights and fundamental freedom. 

The Convention established the European Court of Human Rights. Any 
person who feels their rights have been violated under the Convention 
by a state party can take a case to the court; the decisions of the court 
are legally binding, and the court has the power to award damages. 
The establishment of a court to protect individuals from human rights 
violations is an innovative feature for an international convention on 
human rights. The European Convention is the only international 
human rights agreement providing such a high degree of individual 
protection. 

The main rights and freedom of the European Convention on Human 
Rights are as follows: 

* Article 1 - obligation to respect human right 
* Article 2 - right to life 
* Article 3 - prohibition of torture 
* Article 4 - prohibition of slavery 
* Article 5 - right to liberty and security 40 Visual Memes

* Article 15 - derogations 
* Article 16 - exemption for political activities of aliens 
* Article 17 - prohibition of abuse of rights 
* Article 18 - limitations on permitted restrictions of rights 

On Dec 10, 1948 General Assembly of the United Nation ratified the 
Charter of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and asked the 
member states to disseminate, display, read and expounded 
principally in schools and other educational institutions, without 
distinction based on the political status of countries or territories.
